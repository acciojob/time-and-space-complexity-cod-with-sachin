<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<span>Time complexity, efficient</span>
	<p>So, the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>

<span><b>Space Complexity,</b> O(n)</span>
	
<p>O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>
